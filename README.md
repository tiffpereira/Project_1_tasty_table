# Project_1_tasty_table
Project 1 for GA using an API to create a user friendly site for recipes! 

In this project, theMealDB API is used to output recipes based on the input from the user. In addition, if the user does not know what they would like to eat there is a randomizer button that suggests different recipes to them.
